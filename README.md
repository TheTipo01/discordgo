# DiscordGo ozraru fork

This is fork of [bwmarrin/discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

If you want to use my patches before they are merged, you can use this repository.
Otherwise, I recommend to use upstream.

go.mod example
```
replace github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo => github.com/ozraru/discordgo v0.26.2-0.20250118163132-f992cd170161
```
